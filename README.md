# Vue/NuxtJs Demo!

Hello there. Welcome to the VueJs Demo at iSoftStone. We'll be using this shell to build out a portfolio site for
a fake photographer/ developer named Paul Holly. This Demo isn't mobile ready, but hey, we're just building out a demo.

## Getting Started

You'll need a couple of things to follow along in during the live coding session. First off you'll need yarn installed. Secondly, you'll need a text editor set up. I use VSCode (but Sublime, or Atom work just as well), along with a suite of extensions to speed things up a bit, but you won't really need those. They're just nice. I use the Vue VSCode Snippets by Sarah Drasner. Bellow you will find instructions for getting a copy of this repo running.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
