# Vue/NuxtJs Demo!

Hello there. This is a demo for a intro to Vue talk I gave at my employer. The goal was to give the team an overview of VueJs before working on building out a portion of the project you see here. The work here is greatly informed by a Sarah Drasner's Smashing Talk in July of 2019.

This project is bootstrapped with Nuxt Js, a Vue Js framework that gives us a lot of fun things like built in routing and vuex store.

You can find a working version of this demo here: (https://app.netlify.com/sites/suspicious-perlman-992b66/overview)[Paul Holly Photographer]

## Getting Started

You'll need a couple of things to follow along in during the live coding session. First off you'll need yarn installed. Secondly, you'll need a text editor set up. I use VSCode (but Sublime, or Atom work just as well), along with a suite of extensions to speed things up a bit, but you won't really need those. They're just nice. I use the Vue VSCode Snippets by Sarah Drasner. Bellow you will find instructions for getting a copy of this repo running.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
